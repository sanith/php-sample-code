DEAR SIR,									                    26.02.2015
SUB: MATTRESSES ORDERED FROM FUTURE RETAIL ON 30.10.2014
WE HAD PLACED AN ORDER FOR SIX MATTRESSES 
WE RECEIVED A CALL LATER ON THE 30TH OF NOVEMBER SAYING THAT THE 
MATTRESSES WERE READY FOR DELIVERY. WE REQUESTED FOR A SITE INSPECTION 
TO CHECK QUALITY AND SIZE SPECIFICATIONS. WE WERE ENSURED THAT ALL THE 
MATTRESSES WOULD BE AS PER SIZE AND INSPECTION WAS NOT REQUIRED AND ALSO
 NOT POSSIBLE. WE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO TRUST AND WE AGREED.
THE SIX MATTRESSES THAT ARRIVED, IT WAS FOUND THAT THREE MATTRESSES WERE
 NOT AS PER SIZE AND HENCE WERE RETURNED. I REQUESTED THE CONCERNED 
PERSONS IN THE MATTRESS DEPARTMENT TO DEPUTE SOMEONE TO COME AND RECHECK
 THE MEASUREMENTS AND THEN SEND THE MATTRESSES. I WAS TOLD THAT THE 
PERSON FROM PEPS COMPANY WOULD BE DEPUTED TO COME BUT NO ONE TURNED UP. 

THEREAFTER ONCE AGAIN WE RECEIVED THREE MATTRESSES WHICH THE COMPANY 
CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN RECTIFIED AS PER REQUIREMENT.  OUT OF THE THREE 
MATRESSESES RECEIVED, ONLY ONE MATTRESS IN THE LOT OF THREE RECEIVED WAS
 MEETING THE SIZE REQUIREMENT AND HENCE IT WAS ACCEPTED AND TWO 
MATTRESSES SENT BACK. 

OUT OF THE TWO MATTRESSES SENT BACK, ONE MATTRESS WAS A RESTONIC 
MATTRESS REQUIRED IN 5&quot; THICKNESS WHEREAS THE SAME WAS SENT IN 6&quot; 
THICKNESS AND HENCE IT DID NOT FIT INTO THE FOLDING BED FOR WHICH IT WAS
 ORDERED. 
IT WAS LATER INFORMED FROM THE STORE THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A 
RESTONIC MATTRESS IN 5&quot; THICKNESS IN THE RESTONIC RANGE AND HENCE THE 
SPINEGAURD MATTRESS WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN AND FOR WHICH AN AMOUNT OF 
Rs.4500 WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID EXTRA.
ONCE AGAIN WE OBLIGED AND AFTER MAKING PAYMENT OF THE AMOUNT THE ORDER 
FOR THE BALANCE TWO MATTRESSES WAS PUT INTO PROCESS AND THEREAFTER 
DISPATCHED AFTER SOME DAYS.  

THE TWO MATTRESSES THAT WERE SENT TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG ONCE AGAIN IN 
THE FOLLOWING MANNER:
a.	 ANOTHER VERSION OF SPINEAURD WAS SENT BUT WAS A LITTLE MORE 
EXPENSIVE THAN THE ONE ORDERED FOR, AS SAID BY THE STORE PERSON, AND 
HENCE A DEMAND FOR AN ADDITIONAL Rs.2000 WAS RAISED. UPON REFUSAL TO 
ACCEPT THE MATTRESS I WAS INFORMED BY THE COMPANY THAT THE MATTRESS WAS A
 MISTAKE FROM THEIR END AND HENCE WAS BEING GIVEN WITHOUT LEVY OF THE 
EXTRA CHARGE.
b.	THE 6TH AND FINAL MATTRESS WAS ONCE AGAIN NOT AS PER SIZE. 
MEASUREMENT WAS    CHECKED BY THE DELIVERY PERSON AND ALSO THE 
MEASUREMENT OF THE BED AND ACCEPTED AND TAKEN BACK.
HENCE ONE MATTRESS WAS RETAINED AND ONE LAST MATTRESS WAS ONCE AGAIN 
SENT BACK.

NOW AFTER NEARLY TWO MONTHS, ON THE 11TH OF JANUARY 2015 I WAS BEING 
TOLD TO PAY Rs.3500 AND THE CORRECT MATTRESS WOULD BE SENT AFTER TAKING 
OF THE BED MEASUREMENT.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT THE MATTRESS SHALL 
ONLY BE DELIVERED AFTER MAKING OF THE PAYMENT.  I CONVINCED THE 
COMMUNICATING PERSON THAT IT WAS VERY UNETHICAL FOR A COMPANY TO MAKE 
SUCH WRONG DEMANDS. ALSO TO SAY THAT ONLY AFTER MAKING PAYMENT WOULD 
SOMEBODY BE DEPUTED TO COME AND TAKE MEASUREMENT WAS ALL A MATTER OF 
TRUST. I AND MY ENTIRE FAMILY HAD TRUSTED FUTURE GROUP AND MADE ADVANCE 
PAYMENTS FOR MATTRESSESES WHICH WERE NOT EVEN DELIVERED TO MY DOORSTEP 
ON TRUST.  




AFTER HAVING MADE SUCH A FIASCO IN THE SIX MATTRESSES, I WAS BIENG TOLD 
TO MAKE PAYMENT FIRST OR ELSE NO ACTION WOULD BR TAKEN WAS SOMETHING 
ABSURD. FINALLY, AT THE END OF THE CONVERSTAION I HAD TO STAND UP AND 
SAY THAT I WOULD TAKE THE MATTER TO THE SENIORS AND IF NEEDED TAKE IT UP
 LEGALLY AND GET MY ISSUE SOLVED AND I DID NOT WISH TO DISCUSS THIS 
MATTER.  

I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF LODGING THIS COMPLAINT AND I RECEIVED A CALL 
FROM THE MATTRESS DIVISION ON THE 13TH OF JANUARY 2015 THAT THEY HAD 
CONSIDERED THE ENTIRE ISSUE AND HAD DECIDED TO WAIVE THE EXTRA DEMAND OF
 RS.3500. ALSO A PERSON WOULD BE DEPUTED TO TAKE AND VERIFY THE PROPER 
MEASUREMENT AND THEREAFTER THE CORRECT MATTRESS WOULD BE DELIVERED.  A 
PERSON WAS DEPUTED. HE CAME, CHECKED, AND ONCE AGAIN VERIFIED THE 
MEASUREMENTS. 

HOWEVER, AFTER HAVING MADE CALLS A COUNTLESS NUMBER OF TIMES, FINALLY ON
 THE 21ST OF FEBRUARY WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM HOMETOWN THAT THE MATTRESS
 WAS GOING TO BE DELIVERED THE NEXT DAY I.E. 23RD FEBRUARY 2015. THE 
MATTRESS DID ARRIVE ON THE 23RD OF FEBRUARY 2015, BUT AS USUAL WAS 
IMPROPER IN MEASUREMENT. 
1.	THICKNESS OOF THE MATTRESS INSTEAD OF BIENG 5? THICK WAS 7? THICK.
2.	THE DIMENSIONS OD LENGTH ALSO WERE MUCH MORE THAN THE BED SIZE.
3.	THIS WAS MEASURED AND ACKNOWLEDGED AND ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE 
DELIVERING THE MATTRESS. 
4.	THE DELIVERY VAN DRIVER IN REVERSING THE VAN DAMAGED THE FIRE 
FIGHTING SYSTEM SPRINKLER ON THE CEILING OF THE PODIUM AREA WHICH 
RESULTED IN THE FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT TO GET ACTIVATED AND ALSO A LOSS
 OF A LOT OF WATER BEFORE ANY CORRECTIVE MEASURES COULD BE TAKEN.  TO 
MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE SOCIETY HAS TAKEN IN WRITING THE DAMAGE DONE AND 
SHALL BE SOON PRESENTING US WITH A BILL FOR REIMBURSING THE DAMAGE AND 
THE LOSS OF WATER INCURRED.
THE LAST MEASUREMENT BEFORE DELIVERY WAS TAKEN BY YOUR STAFF PERSON AND 
IN SPITE OF THE SAME A WRONG MATTRESS HAS BEEN DELIVERED.

WE FEEL THAT THIS IS THE ULTIMATE AND THE LIMIT FOR TOLERANCE AND 
PATIENCE HAS BEEN REACHED BY US. WE HAVE ALL ALONG WAITED PATIENTLY FOR 
THE PAST 3 MONTHS FOR THIS LAST MATTRESS ISSUE TO BE SOLVED BUT SINCE IT
 IS NOT MEETING THE MARK IN SPITE OF A NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS IT SHOULD BE 
PUT ASIDE. 

WE WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST YOU TO KINDLY ARRANGE TO CANCEL THE ORDER FOR 
THIS LAST MATTRESS AND REFUND OUR AMOUNT FOR ONE MATTRESS TO MAKE THINGS
 EASIER FOR ALL OF US. 
THE DETAILS ARE AS FOLLOWS :

1.INVOICE NO. 91366056 DTD. 23.02.2015 (BUYER ORDER NO.2088083129 DTD. 
21.02.2015) 	Rs. 30,726.00
2. ADDITION AMOUNT CALLED FOR AND COLLECTED FROM US AGAIN 				Rs.   
4,500.00
TOTAL AMOUNT DUE REFUND 									Rs. 35,226.00

KINDLY ARRANGE TO REVERT BACK AS TO HOW AND WHEN THE AMOUNT SHALL BE 
REFUNDED.

THANKING YOU,
